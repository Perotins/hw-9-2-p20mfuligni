### The Math Module

---

Answer each of the following questions in the same Python file. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. You will need the math module for this assignment so be sure to import it at the beginning of your file.

Each question should consist of 2 lines. The first line should be a comment with *Question #* where *#* is the number of the question. The second line should print the use of a function of the math module to evaluate the expression.

*Example*

``` python
# Question 0
print(math.pi)
```

1. Write a line of code that returns square root of `529`.

2. Write a line of code that returns the sine of `0`.

3. Write a line of code that returns the cosine of `2 pi`.

4. Write a line of code that returns 2.5 raised to the power of `5`.

5. Write a line of code that returns the natural log of `e`.

6. Write a line of code that returns e raised to the power of `4`.

7. Write a line of code that returns the ceiling of `-12.9`.

8. Write a line of code that returns the floor of `7.25`.

9. Write a line of code that returns the natural log of `1000` times `2`.

10. Write a line of code that converts `180` degrees to radians.
